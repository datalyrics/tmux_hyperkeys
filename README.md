If you use these four things:
- MacOS
- Hyperkey (Caps-Lock -> Shift+Command+Options+Control); see. https://hyperkey.app/
- Alacritty
- tmux

..., then you might not want to switch to command mode when using tabs and split screens, just to split the shell horizontally, for example. How cool would it be if I just pressed the hyperkey+H? That's exactly what this configuration does.
Supported among others:

- Saving the tmux (Hyperkey+s)
- Recovery tmux (Hyperkey+r)
- open new tab (Hyperkey+t)
- close tab (Hyperkey+x)
- switch between tabs (Hperkey+ [0-9])
- split horizontally (Hyperkey+h)
- split vertically (Hyperkey+v)
- Navigation between the split screens (Hyperkey+ [Arrow keys])
